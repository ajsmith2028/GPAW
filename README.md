This repository contains files useful to installing GPAW
at Brown University's cluster (Center for Computation and Visualization).

These files are adapted from those made by the CCV.

They are grouped into folders based on the version of GPAW.
Within each version's folder, you should find a `README.md` file containing instructions for that particular version.
